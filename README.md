## ðŸŒŠ Project

A simple water flow simulation over a terrain.

The project is fully written in C++ with the OpenGL framework.

## ðŸ’» Installation

You need `CMake` 3.13 or above
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/zer0nim/mod1
cd mod1
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

 ## ðŸš€ Usage

The program uses at least one **map file** as input.
The file contains some points height to define were the Terrain should pass.
You can view  some example maps format in the `asset/map` folder.

```usage
usage: ./mod1 <map1.mod1> <map2.mod1> ...
```

 ```bash
 ./mod1 asset/map/example1.mod1 asset/map/example2.mod1 asset/map/example3.mod1 asset/map/example4.mod1
 ```

If you want, you can edit some settings (resolution, keys, ...). After starting the program at least once, modify the `configs/settings.json` and/or `configs/controls.json` files.

### Water flow simulation
For the water simulation, I used the Pipe Method. Only the water surface is represented with a height field, modeling the flow between adjacent columns of fluid by using a system of virtual pipe connection.

### Terrain interpolation

The Terrain is represented by a height field, the terrain should cross some points defined by a map file (example in the asset/map folder).
Then I interpolate the other points by using an Inverse Distance Weighting Interpolation algorithm.

### Terrain/water rendering

I render the terrain and water height field using a single OpenGL triangle strip.

The water use the skybox environment mapping to simulate reflection.

### Mouse Picking with Ray Casting
For the sandbox simulation, I used raycast to detect were to put water in the ground.
